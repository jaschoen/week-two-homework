require 'csv'
-bring the csv method into the program
f = File.read('sample.csv')
-reads and stores contents of sample.csv into a new variable f as a big string of data
parsed = CSV.parse(f)
-parses csv into an array of 3 arrays
parsed
-returns the already parsed array
parsed[0]
-returns the first row of the parsed array
parsed[0][0]
-returns the first string in the first row of the parsed array
parsed[1][0]
-returns the first string in the second row of the parsed array


Part 3
C age =25 is the correct way

def is define
say_hello is the method name
name is the arbitrary name of the argument the method takes
puts prints to screen with a line after it
"hello" is a string
name is the argument passed to the method
end tells the program it's the last line of the method

part 4
.join returns a string by converting each element of the array to a string separated by the given separator
ex. 
["a",\"b","c","d"].join #=> "abcd"
["a",\"b","c","d"].join("-") #=> "a-b-c-d"

.shift removes the first element in an array and returns it
ex.
args =["J", "A", "S"]
args.shift #=> "J"
args #=> ["A", "S"]

.pop does the same thing, but for the last element in an array.  Pop it off the end and return it.


for future homework, will want to 
clone it, cd into it, mkdir there, cd into it, git checkout, git add . will add everything
checkout a branch
